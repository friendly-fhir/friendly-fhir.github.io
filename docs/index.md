# Friendly FHIR

The **Friendly FHIR** GitHub organization is a collection of open-source [FHIR]
projects that aim to overall improve the state of FHIR implementations. Overall
the goal is to provide a collection of high-quality, open-source tools and
libraries that can be used to build FHIR applications and services, making it
more accessible to developers and organizations.

## Why FHIR?

FHIR is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. It is
a modern standard that is designed to be easy to implement and use, and is
currently seen as one of the most promising standards for healthcare data
in our future.

Although FHIR itself as a standard has made remarkable progress for adoption and
contributions since its inception, the state of open-source tooling around FHIR
is actually rather limited. This is where **Friendly FHIR** comes in.

We aim to provide a collection of high-quality, open-source tools and libraries
that can be used to build FHIR applications and services, making it more
accessible to developers and organizations.
