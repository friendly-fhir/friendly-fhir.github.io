# Open-Source Licensing

![osi-approved-license](./osi-approved-300x350.png "OSI Approved License")

**Friendly FHIR** is fully committed to the principles of open-source software.

This document outlines the licensing policy for repositories within the
organization.

## Licensing

Unless otherwise specified, all repositories within the Friendly FHIR organization
are **dual-licensed** under both the [MIT License] and the
[Apache License, Version 2.0], at the user's discretion.

[MIT License]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
[Apache License, Version 2.0]: https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0

## Why Dual Licensing?

Dual licensing simply means offering the same software under two different
licenses. What this practically means is that user's can choose the license that
best fits their legal or business needs. Providing more tha one license just
offers better flexibility that can support both individual users _and_
organization requirements.

As for why these two licenses in particular:

* **MIT License** -- this is a simple and permissive license that's tried and
  true in the industry. It allows anyone to use, copy, modify, and distribute
  the software with minimal restrictions.
  Overall, it's easy to understand and very business-friendly.

* **Apache 2 License**: Provides similar freedoms as the MIT license but
  includes explicit terms for patent rights and a requirement to state any
  changes made to the code.
  This helps protect contributors and ensures transparency.

## License Files

Each repository, unless licensed differently, will already be set up with both
licenses in the root of the repository -- available as `LICENSE-MIT` and
`LICENSE-APACHE`.
